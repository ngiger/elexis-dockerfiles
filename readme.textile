h1. Dockerfiles for elexis

Here you find a few dockerfiles which you might find interesting for playing around with docker to simplify the setup for the various elements.

Consult the readme.textile in each subdirectory you are intersted in. Their purpose are

* build_elexis:  Complete environment, which lets you build and run the unit test for elexis-3-core and elexis-3-base
* elexis_test: Run the elexis-3-core + base with a demoDB, ch.elexis.base.ch.feature and some commonly used
* jenkins: Run the Jenkins-CI with the same sets of plugins as under https://jenkins.elexis.info/jenkins/
* mediawiki: Run a mediawiki enviroment (at the moment ahead of the actual wiki.elexis.info)
* nginx: The nginx server needed for the mediawiki PHP5 with FPM
* srv.elexis.info: Upcoming, my plans for using docker on srv.elexis.info (after upgrading it to jessie and making it work). A simple docker-compose.yml

h2. Requirement

A running docker installation with a quite recent docker version (I am running 1.6.2 at the moment).

Support for older docker version is no priority for me, but patches to support them would probably considered.

I try to base my dockerfiles on Debian:jessie
