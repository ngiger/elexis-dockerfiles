h1. Dockerfile to build elexis

Build Elexis 3.1.snapshot in a Docker container on a linux host

We need a X-environment (provided by Xvfb) to run the tests during the build.

h2. Requirements

* Docker 1.6+
* An X11 socket

h2. to build

We need to mount a host directory, eg. /opt/elexis-3, which we will share between the host and the container.

Run @./build_elexis@ to run start the docker and build elexis inside (via the script assets/build_inside_container, which was copied to /usr/local/bin/build_inside_container during docker build).

I have no idea whether this script works under MacOSX (boot2docker) or Windows.
