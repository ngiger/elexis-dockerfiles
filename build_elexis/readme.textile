h1. Dockerfile to build elexis

Build Elexis 3.1.snapshot in a Docker container on a linux host

We need a X-environment (provided by Xvfb) to run the tests during the build.

h2. Requirements

* Docker 1.6+. To install it look at http://docs.docker.com/installation/

h3. building the container

* @docker build -t $USER/build_elexis .@

It will not produce a P2 site for the elexis-3-cor on the first run, as I don't know yet to avoid the complaint about the missing depencies. On the second run it should pass.

h3. build elexis inside the container

The script @./build_elexis@ runs the build script via the following steps

* @mkdir -p $HOME/build_elexis@ # Creates a directory which is used a docker data container and is shared between the host and the container(as /home/elexis)
* @xhost -@ # To ensure that XQuartz is started on MacOSX and to set later on the permission for X
* Calls @docker run@
** Runs /usr/local/bin/build_inside_container. This script was copied during the build from assets/build_inside_container.

Tested under Linux (Debian/Jessie) and MacOSX (see ../readme.textile).

I have no idea whether this script works under Windows.
