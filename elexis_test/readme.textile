h1. a Dockerfile for running elexis

Inspired by https://github.com/fgrehm/docker-eclipse/raw/master/eclipse

The dockerfile installs all the needed stuff to run the Elexis 3.1.snapshot in a Docker container, namely

* Debian Wheezy (Debian Jessie has a libwebkit which is incompatible with Eclipse 3.8)
* an X environmen (Xvfb)
* abiword (to be able to open ODF documents)
* iceweasel (to be able to open HTML documents)
* icedove (to be able to send e-mail)

h2. Requirements

* Docker 1.6+ (should work fine on 1.0+ but I haven't tried)
* An X11 socket

Tested under Linux (Debian/Jessie) and MacOSX (see ../readme.textile).

h3. building the container

* @docker build -t $USER/elexis_test .@

h3. test elexis inside the container

The script @./build_elexis@ runs the build script via the following steps

* @mkdir -p $HOME/build_elexis@ # Creates a directory which is used a docker data container and is shared between the host and the container(as /home/elexis)
* @xhost -@ # To ensure that XQuartz is started on MacOSX and to set later on the permission for X
* Calls @docker run@
** Runs /usr/local/bin/build_inside_container. This script was copied during the build from assets/build_inside_container.

Tested under Linux (Debian/Jessie) and MacOSX (see ../readme.textile).

I have no idea whether this script works under Windows.
